# Sbobinator

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Story

Since the OpenAI API's release, I've pondered: "Is developing a GPT4-based service truly revolutionary?" To find out, practical coding is key. Thus, Sbobinator emerged—a tool streamlining audio transcription, offering concise summaries. Key points:
- API usage is simple.
- Documentation is comprehensive.
- With standard models, call prices are negligible (e.g., 15 cents utilized here).

Crafting such an app requires merely a weekend, democratizing product development. Yet, navigating sales, customer acquisition, and service conception complexities persists.

Thus, the initial question is affirmed—simplification has indeed been achieved. Technologies are mature and user-friendly. Nevertheless, the journey entails significant challenges, particularly in marketing and customer acquisition.
This endeavor, primarily a proof of concept for a LinkedIn post, prompts contemplation on subsequent steps.
